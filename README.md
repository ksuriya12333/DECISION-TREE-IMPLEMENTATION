Task 1: Classifying Flowers Using a Decision Tree
This task uses a Decision Tree to classify flowers into three types: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Steps:
Load Data – The Iris dataset is imported.

Prepare Data – The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

Train Model – A Decision Tree learns how to classify flowers.

Test Model – Predictions are made and compared to actual labels.

Visualize Tree – The decision tree is displayed to show how decisions are made.

This task helps understand decision-making models that classify data into categories based on key features.

Task 2: Sentiment Analysis Using Logistic Regression
This task involves determining whether a review is positive or negative using Logistic Regression, a machine learning model.

Steps:
Create Dataset – A small dataset with customer reviews and sentiment labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative) is prepared.

Text Processing – Reviews are converted into numbers using TF-IDF, a method that gives importance to words based on their frequency.

Train Model – A Logistic Regression model is trained on the processed data.

Evaluate Model – The model’s accuracy is checked using test data.

Visualize Results – A confusion matrix shows how well the model predicts sentiments.

This task helps in analyzing customer feedback for businesses to improve their services.

Task 3: Image Classification Using CNN
This task uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize objects in images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains pictures of airplanes, cars, cats, dogs, and more.

Steps:
Load Images – The CIFAR-10 dataset is imported.

Preprocess Data – Image pixel values are adjusted for better learning.

Build CNN – A model is created with layers that detect patterns in images.

Train Model – The CNN is trained to recognize objects.

Test Model – The model’s predictions are checked for accuracy.

This task helps in creating smart applications like facial recognition and self-driving cars.

Task 4: Movie Recommendation System Using SVD
This task builds a movie recommendation system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The model suggests movies based on user preferences, similar to Netflix and YouTube.

Steps:
Load Data – The MovieLens dataset with user ratings is imported.

Prepare Data – The dataset is structured to be used for training.

Split Data – It is divided into training and test sets.

Train Model – The SVD algorithm learns user preferences.

Make Recommendations – The trained model predicts ratings for movies a user hasn’t seen.

Evaluate Model – Accuracy is measured using RMSE and MAE scores.

This task helps create personalized recommendations in streaming platforms and e-commerce sites.

Conclusion
These four tasks cover essential machine learning techniques:

Classification (Decision Tree, CNN)

Text Analysis (Logistic Regression)

Recommendation Systems (SVD)

These models help businesses and applications make smart decisions. ​
